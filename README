This is a little WWW-proxy that can communicate over both IPv4 and IPv6. It's
primary use is as stub-proxy between a IPv4-only browser and the rest of the
(v4 and v6) Internet. However, it will work just fine on IPv4-only or IPv6-only
machines.  This proxy is meant to run on a client machine as
frontend to an IPv4-only browser and not to serve a large number of clients and
keep a cache for them. If you need the latter you're much better off with a
full-fledged proxy like squid.

There is remarkably little documentation for this program. Just read the
example config files (www6to4.conf and www6to4_forward.conf) and try
`www6to4 -h` for a list of commandline options.
